## Features Left to Implement

- A bigger and better gallery.

## Testing

I tested this site across Google Chrome, Firefox & Brave and the site fully worked across all three browsers and screen sizes and mobile devives.

## Validator Testing

- HTML

4 errors where found and I couldn't resolve them in time [WSC Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgordonbates.github.io%2FPP1%2Findex.html)

- CSS 

No errors where found [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgordonbates.github.io%2FPP1%2Fgallery.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

## Unfixed Bugs

Some unfixed bugs are spacing around homepage image and text. I couldn't implement padding correct around the text stacked vertically to the right of the image on the first picture.

Two gallery images aren't scaled to the correct aspect ration creating a slight stretch.
