        <p>Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil
            Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar
            Module
            Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface
            six
            hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about
            two
            and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar
            material
            to bring back to Earth. Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in
            lunar
            orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the
            lunar
            surface, at a site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing, before lifting off to rejoin Columbia
            in
            lunar orbit.</p><br>

        <p>Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July
            16
            at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had
            three
            parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to
            Earth; a
            service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and
            water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent
            stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.</p><br>

        <p>After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from
            it
            and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle
            and
            landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to lift off from
            the
            lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the
            maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to
            Earth.
            They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in
            space.</p><br>

        <p>Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. He
            described
            the event as "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively proved
            US victory in the Space Race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling a national goal
            proposed
            in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and
            returning
            him safely to the Earth."</p><br>
